1. **Choose your mounting strategy** based on your environment (personal/team/public)
2. **Copy the appropriate configuration** from `mounting-strategies.json`
3. **Customize for your stack** (replace `claude-nextjs:latest` with your preferred image)
4. **Review security implications** in the Security Guide

Remember: Claude Code and MCP servers work in all configurations - you're just choosing what personal data to expose.
